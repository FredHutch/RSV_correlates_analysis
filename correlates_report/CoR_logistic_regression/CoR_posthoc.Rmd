## Posthoc exploratory analyses

### Baseline positivity

To further investigate the differential between D14 and fold rise markers performance, we look at fold rise more closely in the spaghetti plots that show the markers longitudinally from baseline to D14. Based on the plots, we divide the volunteers into baseline positive and baseline negative and fit regression models including baseline positivity. The results do not support the baseline positivity being a statistically significant effect modifier, probably due to the small sample size.
