# RSV_correlates_analysis
This repository contains RSV correlates analysis SAP and code for the manuscript.

# Code directory structure
All code is organized within the correlates_report folder as follows:
1. CoP_logistic_regression
2. CoP_nonparametric_threshold
3. CoP_principal_stratification
4. CoP_principal_surrogate_pssmooth
5. CoR_logistic_regression
6. SL_optimal_surrogate
7. SL_risk_score
8. exploratory

Run the code within each of the above folders (named according to the analysis) to generate the respective results. These results are then pulled into a pdf report by knitting the Rmarkdown file ``correlates_analysis.Rmd'' located in the correlates_report folder.
